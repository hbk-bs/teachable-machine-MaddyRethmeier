My Idea for the project using teachable machine was the quote: 
"If dangerous why cute". For this reason I created a game that lets the player decide
if they want to cuddle an animal or not. They get points depending on how close their decision matches my own preference. Just because an animal can kill you in under a minute does not mean you can't want to cuddle it.
There are two Modi in my game. In one the player gets shown 20 images and then must decide if he or she wants to cuddle the depicted animal. In the other version they can upload their own pictures and let the teachable machine decide if I would want to cuddle the animal or not. Based on the output of the machine a score is given which depicts the friendship compability of me and the player based on cuddle preference.
I trained the machine with around 150 pictures for each category: cuddle, no preference and no cuddle. Therefore the decision is not always quite correct especially when it comes to the distinction of different reptiles.
